TODO
- Show score and region number
- Attack particle effects should be in front of homes
- Don't show intro screen when returning to the main menu OR stop playing map/battle music
- When restarting the game, reset the map (the player's position, the danger zone)
- Events can't be repeated by returning to the node
- Destroyed homes should stop their wheels and drift off to the left
- Stop wheel animation in battles when the game is paused (don't use Time.deltaTime but GM.Instance.DeltaTime)
- Don't show an attack reload bar if the room cannot attack
- Remove floor selection; it does nothing OR show complete floor stats (damage and dmg types, resistances, hp, comfort, reload time)
- Show weapon base damage
- More rapid stench damage
- Remove damage limit of 10 and fix huge damage bug
- Possibly hide info panel when no item is selected or hovered
- Make the HP, comfort and reload times update in the map screen
- Selecting/hovering nodes should display the name of the event
- Make unreachable and previously visited nodes visually different
- Randomize map rotation in each new region
- Randomize events already when randomizing map
- Random roof OR roof based on the top floor's wall type OR let the player switch the roof in map screen
- Make the flee button unusable if the battle is over
- If the flee button is pressed and the player dies during the delay, make the player lose the game
- Fix the flee button halfway covering it's charge bar
- Fix typos (e.g. "strengTHen", "on THE side of the road", "Luckily,")
- Fix event result text: "They are even more annoyed than you"
- Tutorial
- Fix SFX and music volume levels
- Options menu: SFX and music volume, credits
- Balance items and enemies
- Disable debug controls in build (you can use #if UNITY_EDITOR)
- Add more items and events
- Make sure generated homes have some weapons
- Add rewards to battles
- Add the possibility to lose items in events
- Add the possibility to make events unique, meaning that I cannot happen again during the same game session
- Improvement: Scrap old danger zone and create one with only images upping in scale
- Animate inside of danger zone
- Animate home movement in the map. In idle it could bounce little.
- Make homes sway up and down, left and right in battles
- Add padding (8 pixel ~ish) under and left of inventory and make so that map can be seen under it
- Hovering and selecting items would show bigger image of that item in info panel next to stats
- Add visual effects to damaged floors
- Add something beneath health and comfort to make them pop from the background
- Make health and comfort not cover the item stat screen or be hidden by it
