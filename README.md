# Home Beat Home

Upgrade your mobile home with new furniture and humiliate your foes. The Wasteland is a dangerous place. Here are some life hacks to help you survive:

- TRAVEL by clicking on points on the map
- DISCOVER events in the post-apocalyptic world
- BATTLE with competing homes
- EQUIP cutting edge furniture to strengthen your home
- SURVIVE as long as possible

Explore the world of Home Beat Home and find weird loot, silly situations and heated battles. The battling is automatic; the building types and furniture placed in them decide the victor. Some pieces of furniture can be used as weapons and others boost attack power or defence. Experiment with different combinations to make your home the most powerful (and comfortable) in the Wasteland.

Controls:
- Mouse left click: Do everything except pause the game
